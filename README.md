Dataset Description:
The Spotify dataset contains information such as track names, artists, popularity, and audio features (e.g., danceability, energy). The YouTube dataset includes video titles, channel information, view counts, likes, dislikes, and engagement metrics. Both datasets allow us to analyze content characteristics and how they influence user interaction.
